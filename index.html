The assignment is to make an MVC application used for counting things. Here are the specifications for the application:

It should have three buttons (one for counting up, one for counting down, one for resetting to 0)
It will display the count to the user
If the count goes above 100, the color of the number will be red
If the count goes below 0, the color of the number will be blue

		Using Handlebars to change the color of the count through templating.
		Here, I learned how to use else if in Handlebars, which is pretty
		straightforward: 
		{{I#if (condition here is true)}}
		(then set class equal to this)
		{{else if (this other condition here is true)}}
		(then set class equal to this)
		{{/if (to close if tag nothing is needed here)}}

		You can also use else by taking away the if in the else if portion.

		{{count}} refers to the key of the model object that you want displayed.
